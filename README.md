# USWS-Project of Simulating social platform with generative agents
authors: Annas & Alan

By Running the project you are generating with openai conversations on a daily basis between the generative agents based on the choosen topic, intructions of each agents, older conversations that were stored by chromadb and the high-level reflections also generated by openai based on the conversations.

**You can look up for the output in the file named "results"**

"Unternehmenssoftware" Project 
-
- of the module "Unternehmenssoftware" by Prof. Dr. Axel Hochstein
- Thema 1: Simulation of social platform with generative agents



How to Run the project:
- 
1.  Make sure every neccessary packages are installed (python, openai, chromadb)
2.  To Use openai, register to openai and credit your acc with the mininum amount (5€) so you can use openai
3.  After that follow the documents of openai documentation or create an api key on your openai site
4.  create file in root named "api_key" and copy it into it
5.  configure path of line 9 from main.py so conversations getting stored in project
6.  configure also the path in chromdb.py
7.  you might need to read the documentary of chromadb, too.


# Commands for Windows
```bash
  python --version
```
- falls nicht vorhanden:
```bash
  winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

- danach muss eine virtuelle Umgebung erstellt werden um Kollisionen in Python zu vermeiden, falls bereits python installiert ist
```bash
    py -m venv .venv
````
```bash
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```    

- jetzt muss nur noch das main.py Script ausgeführt werden

# Commands to run before running project on MACOS
```bash
  brew install ollama
```
```bash
  ollama serve
```
```bash
  ollama pull llama3.8b
```
```bash
  pip install chromadb
```
```bash
  pip install sentence-transformers
```

- und dannn mit folgenden Befehlen starten:
```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
```
```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
  python main.py
```



Things you can change to experiment:
-
- changing topic in main.py on line 24
- changing rounds in main.py on line 25
- changing intructions of agents: prompt_templates > instructions (pick one agent and change the character description)
- adding more persons (in main.py on line 20 by adding a new name and new file in instructions regarding to the new name)
